# UnityStereoViewer
The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency tasked my team with creating a way to analyze stereo image pairs on a VR headset. 
We accomplished this task using the Unity game engine and Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK).

In this repository I've included a video demoing the point selection process and the code that facilitates most of this process.
There were lots of other aspects to this internship so please reach out if you're interested to learn more!
